# Guild Documentation
We organize the creation and maintenance of the official Neos and Flow documentation in this repository. We maintain https://docs.neos.io and several ReadTheDocs manuals.

If you found a blind spot or some errors feel free to open an issue here. Or simply join us in our Slack channel #guild-documentation.
